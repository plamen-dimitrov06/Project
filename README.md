# E-learning web resources management and administration system

Allows for uploading and managing e-learning resources. The project was built using MEAN-stack.

## Getting started

In order to run the project locally you can either download a copy to your local machine or clone the project repo. Afterwards you have to install the project dependencies with :

```
npm install
```

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This is used primarily for testing the front-end behavior and in order to test the entire application you can use 'npm start'. This command will execute 'ng build' and node bin/www which will build the client application and run the express web server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. 

### Code scaffolding

Thanks to Angular-CLI you can quickly add aditional components by running `ng generate component component-name`. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Unit tests have not been created yet but they can be ran with `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

End-to-end tests have not been created yet but they can be ran with  `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
